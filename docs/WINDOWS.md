# Windows host

The confirmed host path uses Windows `UsbNcm.sys` and enumerates the device as `UsbNcm Host Device`, VID:PID `2C7C:7006`.

The test addressing is:

```text
T6A       192.168.77.1/24
Windows   192.168.77.2/24
```

Verify enumeration and link carrier before assigning addresses or running iperf. The established vendor baseline is approximately 1.34–1.39 Gbit/s T6A→Windows and 1.01–1.03 Gbit/s Windows→T6A, with the recorded baseline runs showing TCP Retr 0 in the forward direction.
